Length: 15 cm × 200 = **30 m**, Width: 10 cm × 200 = **20 m**\n14. 180 km ÷ 2,000,000 = **9 cm**\n15. 6 cm × 500 = **30 m**\n\n---\n\n## Teaching Notes\n\n### Common Mistakes to Watch For:\n- **Unit Conversion Errors**: Students often forget to convert between cm, m, and km\n- **Scale Confusion**: Mixing up which direction to multiply or divide\n- **Decimal Place Errors**: Especially when converting large numbers\n\n### Extension Activities:\n- Use real local maps to practice scale reading\n- Create scale drawings of classroom or school\n- Investigate different map scales and their uses\n\n### Assessment Criteria:\n- **Excellent (30-35 marks)**: Accurate calculations with proper units and clear working\n- **Good (24-29 marks)**: Most calculations correct with minor unit errors\n- **Satisfactory (18-23 marks)**: Basic understanding shown, some calculation errors\n- **Needs Support (<18 marks)**: Requires additional practice with scale concepts"
