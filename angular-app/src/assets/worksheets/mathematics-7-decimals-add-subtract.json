  "answerKey": "# Answer Key: Adding and Subtracting Decimals\n\n**Grade 7 Mathematics - Medium Difficulty**  \n**Total Marks: 40**\n\n---\n\n## Section A: Basic Addition and Subtraction\n1. 23.4 + 15.7 = **39.1**\n2. 67.89 + 23.4 = **91.29**\n3. 156.7 - 89.3 = **67.4**\n4. 45.67 - 28.9 = **16.77**\n5. 123.456 + 67.89 = **191.346**\n6. 234.5 - 167.89 = **66.61**\n7. 89.7 + 123.45 + 67.8 = **280.95**\n8. 456.78 - 289.456 = **167.324**\n9. 12.345 + 67.8 + 123.45 = **203.595**\n10. 789.4 - 456.789 = **332.611**\n\n## Section B: Mixed Operations\n11. (23.4 + 15.7) - 12.8 = 39.1 - 12.8 = **26.3**\n12. 45.6 - (23.4 + 8.9) = 45.6 - 32.3 = **13.3**\n13. 123.45 + 67.8 - 45.67 = **145.58**\n14. (156.7 - 89.3) + 45.6 = 67.4 + 45.6 = **113.0**\n\n## Section C: Word Problems\n15. $23.45 + $67.89 + $12.34 = **$103.68**\n16. $456.78 - $234.56 = **$222.22**\n17. 2.5 + 1.75 + 0.85 = **5.1 kg**\n18. 3.45 + 2.8 + 4.15 = **10.4 km**\n\n## Section D: Problem Solving Challenges\n19. Apples: 2.5 × $3.45 = $8.625\n    Oranges: 1.8 × $2.89 = $5.202\n    Total cost: $8.625 + $5.202 = $13.827 ≈ **$13.83**\n    Change: $20.00 - $13.83 = **$6.17**\n\n20. Estimate: 20 + 50 + 80 = **150**\n    Exact: 23.7 + 45.9 + 78.2 = **147.8**\n    Difference: 150 - 147.8 = **2.2**\n\n---\n\n## Teaching Notes\n\n### Common Mistakes to Watch For:\n- **Misaligning decimal points**: Students often forget to line up decimal points when adding/subtracting\n- **Placeholder zeros**: Forgetting to add zeros as placeholders when decimal places don't match\n- **Rounding errors**: Rounding too early in multi-step problems\n\n### Extension Activities:\n- Create your own word problems using real-world scenarios\n- Practice mental estimation before calculating\n- Use calculators to check answers after working by hand\n\n### Assessment Criteria:\n- **Excellent (32-40 marks)**: Consistently accurate with clear working shown\n- **Good (24-31 marks)**: Mostly accurate with minor computational errors\n- **Satisfactory (16-23 marks)**: Basic understanding shown, some method errors\n- **Needs Support (<16 marks)**: Requires additional instruction on decimal operations"
