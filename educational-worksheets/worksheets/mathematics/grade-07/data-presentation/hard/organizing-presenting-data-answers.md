## Section A: Theoretical Understanding

### 1. Data Representation Theory (7 marks)
**a) Why pie chart over histogram (3 marks):**
- Pie charts show parts of a whole/categorical data ✓
- Histogram shows frequency distribution of continuous data ✓
- Subject preferences are categorical, not continuous measurements ✓

**b) Pie chart angles (4 marks):**
- Mathematics: (125/500) × 360° = 90° ✓
- Science: (100/500) × 360° = 72° ✓
- English: (75/500) × 360° = 54° ✓
- History: (50/500) × 360° = 36° ✓
- Art: (75/500) × 360° = 54° ✓
- PE: (75/500) × 360° = 54° ✓
(Total should equal 360°)

- External factors (health, stress, distractions) ✓
- Test anxiety or performance on the day ✓

**b) Additional data question (2 marks):**
Accept relevant questions such as:
- "What study methods did you use?" ✓
- "How many hours of sleep did you get?" ✓
- "Did you have any distractions while studying?" ✓

### 4. Histogram Frequency Puzzle (8 marks)
**a) Correct drawing analysis (4 marks):**
- Bar height should be proportional to frequency ✓
- 155-159 cm has frequency 12, 150-154 cm has frequency 8 ✓
- Ratio should be 12:8 = 1.5:1 ✓
- The histogram IS correctly drawn ✓

**b) Symmetric distribution frequencies (4 marks):**
If symmetric with total 40:
- Possible pattern: 4, 8, 12, 12, 4 ✓✓
- Or: 2, 8, 20, 8, 2 ✓✓
- Must show working and total = 40 ✓✓

## Section C: Complex Problem Solving

### 5. Multi-representation Challenge (10 marks)
**a) Calculations (4 marks):**
**Pie chart angles:**
- Car: (96/240) × 360° = 144° ✓
- Public Transport: (72/240) × 360° = 108° ✓
- Walking: (48/240) × 360° = 72° ✓
- Cycling: (24/240) × 360° = 36° ✓

**Waffle diagram:**
- Car: 40 squares, Public Transport: 30 squares ✓
- Walking: 20 squares, Cycling: 10 squares ✓

**b) Audience-appropriate representations (6 marks):**
- **City planners**: Bar chart or histogram for clear comparison of usage numbers ✓✓
- **Environmental activists**: Pie chart to emphasize proportion using cars vs. eco-friendly options ✓✓
- **School children**: Waffle diagram for easy visual understanding ✓✓

### 6. Data Detective (6 marks)
**a) Error identification (4 marks):**
- Check pie chart: 90° + 135° + 90° + 45° = 360° ✓
- Check percentages: 25% + 37.5% + 25% + 12.5% = 100% ✓
- Check bar chart with table: If total = 80, then A should be 20, B should be 30, C should be 20, D should be 10 ✓
- ERROR in table: Shows A=25% of 80 = 20 ✓ but percentages don't match frequencies

**b) Correction (2 marks):**
- Correct frequencies: A=20, B=30, C=20, D=10 (total=80) ✓
- Correct percentages: A=25%, B=37.5%, C=25%, D=12.5% ✓

### 7. Scatter Diagram Construction (6 marks)
**a) Correlation prediction (3 marks):**
- Strong positive correlation expected ✓
- As temperature increases, ice cream sales increase ✓
- Logical reasoning based on real-world experience ✓

**b) Sales estimation for 26°C (3 marks):**
- Method: interpolation between 25°C (75 units) and 28°C (88 units) ✓
- Calculation: approximately 79-82 units ✓
- Justification of interpolation method ✓

### 8. Histogram Intervals Decision (8 marks)
**a) Interval comparison (4 marks):**
**5% intervals:**
- Advantages: More detailed view, better for large datasets ✓
- Disadvantages: Too many bars, harder to see overall pattern ✓

**10% intervals:**
- Advantages: Clearer overall pattern, easier to read ✓
- Disadvantages: Less detail, might miss important features ✓

**b) Recommendation (4 marks):**
- Recommend 10% or 20% intervals ✓
- Reasoning: Current data naturally clusters in these ranges ✓
- Suggested intervals: 20-39%, 40-59%, 60-79%, 80-89%, 90%+ ✓
- Justification based on data distribution ✓

### 9. Critical Analysis (6 marks)
**a) Missing information (3 marks):**
Accept any three of:
- Sample size ✓
- Comparison data (before/after) ✓
- Response rate ✓
- How satisfaction was measured ✓
- Time period of survey ✓
- Demographics of respondents ✓

**b) Better evidence suggestions (3 marks):**
- **Scatter diagram**: Customer satisfaction vs. time since product launch ✓
- **Histogram**: Distribution of satisfaction scores over time ✓
- Show trend data rather than single snapshot ✓

### 10. Data Transformation Challenge (6 marks)
**a) Pie chart calculations (3 marks):**
- Total frequency = 50 ✓
- Angles: 0-19: 21.6°, 20-39: 50.4°, 40-59: 108°, 60-79: 144°, 80-100: 36° ✓
- Show working: (frequency/total) × 360° ✓

**b) Waffle diagram challenges (3 marks):**
- Challenge: 50 total doesn't divide evenly into 100 squares ✓
- Modification: Use 50 squares (each = 1 student) or multiply all by 2 ✓
- Alternative: Use percentages and round to nearest whole square ✓

## Teaching Notes

### Common Mistakes to Watch For:
- **Pie chart calculations**: Students often forget to multiply by 360° or use wrong total
- **Correlation confusion**: Assuming correlation implies causation
- **Histogram vs. bar chart**: Using gaps when data is continuous
- **Scale misunderstanding**: Not considering sample size when interpreting percentages

### Extension Activities:
- **Real data collection**: Have students survey classmates and create multiple representations
- **Media analysis**: Find examples of misleading data presentations in newspapers/online
- **Technology integration**: Use spreadsheet software to create different chart types
- **Cross-curricular connections**: Apply to science experiments or social studies surveys

### Assessment Criteria:
- **Excellent (90-100 marks)**: Demonstrates deep understanding of when and why to use different representations, shows sophisticated reasoning, makes connections between concepts
- **Good (75-89 marks)**: Shows solid understanding with minor gaps, can solve most problems with appropriate methods
- **Satisfactory (60-74 marks)**: Basic understanding of data representations, can complete routine calculations with some support
- **Needs Support (<60 marks)**: Requires significant support with concept understanding and application

### Differentiation Strategies:
- **For advanced learners**: Ask them to create their own data interpretation puzzles
- **For struggling learners**: Provide step-by-step templates for calculations
- **Visual learners**: Use actual manipulatives or online interactive tools
- **Kinesthetic learners**: Have them physically sort data or create human bar charts
