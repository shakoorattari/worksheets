### Self-Assessment
- I can interpret complex visual data representations: ☐ Confident ☐ Mostly ☐ Need practice
- I can identify misleading data presentations: ☐ Confident ☐ Mostly ☐ Need practice  
- I can choose optimal chart types for different purposes: ☐ Confident ☐ Mostly ☐ Need practice
- I can apply logical reasoning to data problems: ☐ Confident ☐ Mostly ☐ Need practice

### Key Methods to Remember
- **Pie Chart**: Angles = (frequency ÷ total) × 360°, best for parts of whole
- **Waffle Diagram**: Uses 100 squares, each square = 1%, excellent for percentages
- **Scatter Diagram**: Shows correlation between two variables, watch for outliers
- **Histogram**: Frequency density = frequency ÷ class width, bars must touch for continuous data
- **Critical Analysis**: Always consider sample size, bias, and context when interpreting data

### Visual Analysis Tips
- Look for scale distortions and misleading proportions
- Check if sample sizes support the conclusions drawn
- Consider alternative explanations for apparent patterns
- Question whether the chart type matches the data type and purpose
