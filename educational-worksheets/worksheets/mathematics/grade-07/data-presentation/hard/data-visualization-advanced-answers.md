**Grade 7 Mathematics - Hard Difficulty**  
**Total Marks: 120**

---

## Section A: Visual Interpretation Challenges

### Question 1: Pie Chart Puzzle
**Total: 7 marks**

a) **Calculate students in each subject (4 marks)**
- Total degrees in circle = 360°
- Math angle = 100°, Science angle = 120°
- Remaining degrees = 360° - 100° - 120° = 140°
- Arts angle = English angle = 140° ÷ 2 = 70° each

Number of students:
- Math: (100°/360°) × 360 = 100 students
- Science: (120°/360°) × 360 = 120 students  
- Arts: (70°/360°) × 360 = 70 students
- English: (70°/360°) × 360 = 70 students

b) **Verify claim about Math students (3 marks)**
- 1/4 of 360 students = 90 students
- Math has 100 students
- Since 100 > 90, the claim "More than 1/4 prefer Math" is **mathematically correct**

### Question 2: Waffle Diagram Logic Trap
**Total: 5 marks**

a) **Verify laptop claim (2 marks)**
- Laptop: 40 squares = 40%
- Tablet: 24 squares = 24%
- 40 ÷ 24 = 1.67 (not exactly 2)
- **Claim is false** - laptops are preferred by 1.67 times as many people, not exactly twice

b) **Identify logical error (3 marks)**
- Smartphones: 28 squares = 28%
- Tablets: 24 squares = 24%
- Combined: 28% + 24% = 52%
- **Error**: 52% is not exactly half (50%)
- The company rounded or made an approximation error

## Section B: Construction and Analysis

### Question 3: Scatter Diagram Detective Work
**Total: 7 marks**

a) **Explain contradictory data points (4 marks)**
Possible explanations:
- **Individual differences**: Some students are naturally better test-takers regardless of sleep
- **Study quality**: The 5-hour student may have studied more effectively
- **Other factors**: Stress levels, breakfast, prior knowledge, test anxiety
- **Data collection error**: Misreported sleep hours or test scores

b) **Predict score for 7.5 hours (3 marks)**
- Looking at trend: 7 hours ≈ 80-90, 8 hours ≈ 90-100
- Predicted range: **85-95%**
- Method: Linear interpolation between existing data points
- Justification: Strong positive correlation suggests this range is reasonable

### Question 4: Histogram Frequency Trick
**Total: 8 marks**

a) **Identify misleading elements and calculate frequency density (5 marks)**
**Misleading because**: Unequal intervals shown with equal bar widths distorts frequency density

Interval widths:
- 0-20: width = 20
- 20-35: width = 15  
- 35-55: width = 20
- 55-80: width = 25

Frequency density = frequency ÷ class width:
- 0-20: 5 ÷ 20 = 0.25
- 20-35: 10 ÷ 15 = 0.67
- 35-55: 10 ÷ 20 = 0.50  
- 55-80: 5 ÷ 25 = 0.20

b) **Redesign with correct proportions (3 marks)**
Bar widths should be proportional to interval widths:
- 0-20: width 4 units (20÷5), height 5
- 20-35: width 3 units (15÷5), height 10
- 35-55: width 4 units (20÷5), height 10
- 55-80: width 5 units (25÷5), height 5

## Section C: Multi-Step Problem Solving

### Question 5: Data Representation Strategy Game
**Total: 12 marks**

a) **Create frequency tables (6 marks)**

**(i) Histogram with 5 equal intervals:**
Range: 16-65 = 49, so interval width = 49÷5 ≈ 10

| Interval | Frequency |
|----------|-----------|
| 16-25    | 6         |
| 26-35    | 5         |
| 36-45    | 4         |
| 46-55    | 3         |
| 56-65    | 2         |

**(ii) Pie chart with 4 age groups:**
| Age Group | Count | Percentage | Angle |
|-----------|-------|------------|-------|
| 16-25     | 6     | 30%        | 108°  |
| 26-35     | 5     | 25%        | 90°   |
| 36-50     | 6     | 30%        | 108°  |
| 51-65     | 3     | 15%        | 54°   |

b) **Best for "young adults" claim (3 marks)**
**Pie chart with strategic grouping**: Group 16-35 as "young adults" (55% of total)
This clearly shows majority are young adults

c) **Best for "broad age appeal" (3 marks)**  
**Histogram with equal intervals**: Shows relatively even distribution across age ranges
Demonstrates consistent appeal across different age groups

### Question 6: Misleading Chart Challenge
**Total: 13 marks**

a) **Calculate weighted average (4 marks)**
Weighted average = Σ(hours × sample size) ÷ total sample size
= (8.2×50 + 6.8×200 + 4.5×300 + 3.2×100) ÷ (50+200+300+100)
= (410 + 1360 + 1350 + 320) ÷ 650
= 3340 ÷ 650 = **5.14 hours**

b) **Three major errors (6 marks)**
1. **Ignores sample sizes**: Should weight by number of people in each group
2. **Wrong chart type**: Pie charts show parts of whole, not independent measurements
3. **Misleading proportions**: Raw hours don't represent population proportions

c) **Recommended chart type (3 marks)**
**Bar chart or column chart** showing:
- X-axis: Age groups
- Y-axis: Average daily hours  
- Bar heights proportional to usage hours
- Include sample sizes as labels

### Question 7: Advanced Correlation Analysis
**Total: 7 marks**

a) **Correlation strength (3 marks)**
**Strong positive correlation** (approximately 0.7-0.8)
- Clear upward trend with most points following the pattern
- Few outliers, general linear relationship visible
- Strong enough to make reasonable predictions

b) **Identify logical fallacy (4 marks)**
**Fallacy**: Confusing correlation with causation
**Counterarguments**:
- Other factors affect grades: natural ability, teaching quality, prior knowledge
- Reverse causation possible: good students may choose to study more
- Lurking variables: family support, socioeconomic status, health

## Section D: Critical Thinking Extensions

### Question 8: Perfect Data Presentation
**Total: 12 marks**

a) **Three different representations (9 marks)**

**School Board (formal):**
- Bar chart with exact percentages labeled
- Professional color scheme, clear axis labels
- Include trend line and statistical summary

**Parents (accessible):**
- Simple pie chart with friendly colors
- Focus on "Most days show good attendance"
- Minimize Friday's lower number, emphasize overall positive

**Students (engaging):**
- Creative visual like attendance "thermometer"
- Gamification elements, progress indicators
- Challenge format: "Can we get Friday to 85%?"

b) **Predict misinterpretations (3 marks)**
- **Board**: May focus only on Friday drop, miss overall trend
- **Parents**: May not notice day-to-day variations
- **Students**: May see it as game rather than serious issue

### Question 9: Data Transformation Logic
**Total: 10 marks**

a) **Pie chart angles (4 marks)**
- Spring: (28/100) × 360° = 100.8°
- Summer: (40/100) × 360° = 144°
- Autumn: (16/100) × 360° = 57.6°
- Winter: (16/100) × 360° = 57.6°

b) **Scale to 250 people (3 marks)**
- Spring: 28% × 250 = 70 people
- Summer: 40% × 250 = 100 people
- Autumn: 16% × 250 = 40 people  
- Winter: 16% × 250 = 40 people

c) **Create grouped histogram (3 marks)**
- Warm seasons (Spring + Summer): 70 people (68%)
- Cool seasons (Autumn + Winter): 40 people (32%)
- Frequency ratio: 1.75:1 (warm:cool)

### Question 10: Statistical Reasoning Challenge  
**Total: 12 marks**

a) **Three statistical problems (6 marks)**
1. **Different sample sizes**: 50 vs 500 people - not comparable
2. **Selection bias**: Who chose to continue using the app?
3. **No control group**: Were these the same people? Other factors?

b) **Design reliable study (6 marks)**
**Improved design:**
- **Same participants**: Track same 200 people before/after
- **Control group**: 100 use app, 100 don't  
- **Duration**: Measure for 3 months consistently
- **Data collection**: Automatic tracking, not self-reported
- **Chart type**: Line graph showing progress over time
- **Controls**: Similar age, activity level, motivation

## Teaching Notes

### Common Mistakes to Watch For:
- **Pie chart calculations**: Students often forget total degrees = 360°
- **Frequency density**: Confusing frequency with frequency density in histograms
- **Correlation vs causation**: Assuming correlation implies cause-and-effect
- **Scale awareness**: Not noticing when axes or intervals are misleading
- **Sample size importance**: Ignoring how sample size affects reliability

### Extension Activities:
- **Real data collection**: Have students survey classmates and create multiple representations
- **Media analysis**: Find misleading charts in newspapers/websites and critique them
- **Chart makeover**: Take a poorly designed chart and improve it
- **Prediction games**: Use scatter plots to make and test predictions

### Assessment Criteria:
- **Excellent (100-120 marks)**: Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of data representation, identifies subtle misleading elements, provides nuanced explanations
- **Good (80-99 marks)**: Shows solid grasp of chart types and calculations, recognizes obvious errors, explains reasoning clearly  
- **Satisfactory (60-79 marks)**: Can perform basic calculations and interpretations, may miss some misleading elements
- **Needs Support (<60 marks)**: Struggles with chart interpretation, calculation errors, requires additional practice with fundamentals

### Key Misconceptions to Address:
- **"Bigger bars always mean more important"**: Teach about frequency density and appropriate scaling
- **"Correlation means causation"**: Emphasize lurking variables and alternative explanations
- **"All charts show the same information equally well"**: Demonstrate how chart choice affects interpretation
- **"Visual representations are always accurate"**: Develop critical analysis skills for misleading graphics
